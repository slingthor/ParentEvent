# ParentEvent
A highly type safe and simple to use C# global event dispatcher. 

See Example.cs for usage examples.

You create new events by deriving from ParentEvent to create a new type, and deriving alone is all what's needed to create a new global event.

Reccomend using namespacing to easily group the global events in an easily addressable area in the code.
